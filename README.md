# ITC Resume maker

You can check out the live preview [here](https://golannnnn.github.io/itc_resume/).

This is a single page application that allows you to create a custom resume by hovering over the different sections of the resume and editing them. You can add sections, remove sections, and edit the content of the sections. You can download and print the resume.

This is still a work in progress, feel free to contribute!
